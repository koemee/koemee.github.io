# My Personal Portfolio Website

![logo](screenshot.png)

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website,
which you can find at [https://overgroup.me](https://overgroup.me).

I tried to make the website in the simplest way I could, not
utilizing any frameworks, libraries, or even multiple files.
As a result, the code should be extremely simple to browse
and use for your own purposes. I am releasing this code for
free with no license, you can distribute it however you like,
but I do not claim ownership for any damages caused by use of
any of this code.
